        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Buducnost-announces-casino-backoff"><a href="#Buducnost-announces-casino-backoff" class="headerlink" title="Buducnost announces casino backoff"></a>Buducnost announces casino backoff</h1><p>On Wednesday, January 3, the Montenegrin government announced its decision to halt the construction of a casino in Buducnost. The justification for the move was economic, with government officials stating that the casinos would have a negative effect on the economy. This decision is a reversal of the 2015 decision to allow casino construction in the city.</p>
<p>The mayor of Buducnost, Nebojsa Kavaric, stated that he was against the casino project and said that it would have negative consequences for the city. He also noted that many other municipalities in Montenegro were also opposed to casinos.</p>
<p>The government’s decision comes as a surprise since there has been no public outcry against the casino and it has been seen as a much-needed development project for Buducnost. It is possible that the government’s decision is related to upcoming elections, which are scheduled for later in 2018.</p>
<p>Casinos are seen as a major source of revenue for governments, so it will be interesting to see how this decision affects Buducnost’s coffers.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Backoff-Could-Hurt-Buducnost’s-Bottom-Line"><a href="#Casino-Backoff-Could-Hurt-Buducnost’s-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Casino Backoff Could Hurt Buducnost’s Bottom Line"></a>Casino Backoff Could Hurt Buducnost’s Bottom Line</h1><p>In a recent development, the casino regulator in Montenegro has excluded Buducnost from its list of licensed operators. This is a big blow to the company as it is one of its main moneymakers.</p>
<p>Buducnost is not new to this type of issue. The casino business has been under fire for quite some time now as it is believed to be fueling crime in the country. In response, the government has been trying to crack down on the industry by doing things like banning visible gambling signs and limiting when casinos can operate.</p>
<p>This latest development could end up hurting Buducnost’s bottom line. The company’s stock took a hit when the news came out and it is likely that revenue will suffer as well. This could have a negative impact on the company’s future plans, including its goal of becoming a regional player.</p>
<p>It is still too early to say how this will play out, but it is clear that Buducnost faces some challenges ahead.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Backoff-Hurts-Tourism-in-Buducnost"><a href="#Casino-Backoff-Hurts-Tourism-in-Buducnost" class="headerlink" title="Casino Backoff Hurts Tourism in Buducnost"></a>Casino Backoff Hurts Tourism in Buducnost</h1><p>Montenegro’s bid to join the European Union has been stalled by Brussels over concerns about money-laundering and organized crime, which some peg to casino operations in the coastal town of Buducnost.</p>
<p>The casinos were openly touted as a way to revive the ailing local economy when they opened in 2016, but officials now admit that the industry is mired in corruption and organized crime. Some €4 million has already been seized from casino owners and managers in connection with money-laundering investigations.</p>
<p>That’s bad news for a town that was counting on the casino revenue to help revive its economy. The gambling halls were expected to create 1,500 jobs and generate €30 million annually in taxes and fees. But with the industry under a cloud of suspicion, those numbers are unlikely to be reached.</p>
<p>Tourism officials say the backoff is hurting Buducnost’s image as a holiday destination. “The negative associations with casinos are now also concerning potential tourists, who see this as an obstacle for Montenegro’s EU accession process,” said Ratomir Ivanovic, director of the regional tourist organization Crna Gora Marketing.</p>
<p>Ivanovic added that some tourists are opting for other destinations because of the perception that Montenegro is not clean enough to join the EU. That’s a big blow for a country that relies heavily on tourism – it accounts for more than 25 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The government says it is committed to cleaning up the casino industry, but it will be a uphill battle. Officials acknowledge that they were naive in thinking that gambling could solve Buducnost’s economic problems and they are now looking for other ways to revive the town.</p>
<h1 id="What-will-be-the-next-step-for-Buducnost-after-casino-backoff"><a href="#What-will-be-the-next-step-for-Buducnost-after-casino-backoff" class="headerlink" title="What will be the next step for Buducnost after casino backoff?"></a>What will be the next step for Buducnost after casino backoff?</h1><p>Buducnost is a Montenegrin professional basketball club based in Podgorica. The club was founded in 1945. Buducnost currently plays in the ABA League and Adriatic League. The team has won six national championships and four national cups.<br>After the decision of the Buducnost’s Management Board to back off from the casino project, many people are asking what will be the next step for this big basketball club. Some say that this could mean a lot of bad things for Buducnost because the management board didn’t give any explanation for this decision.</p>
<p>However, there are also some people who believe that this could be a good thing for Buducnost because now they can focus exclusively on basketball, which is their main sport. The club has a lot of young talented players and they could become even better if they focus on training and improving their skills.</p>
<p>The president of the club, Miodrag Šumonja, said that the decision to back off from the casino project was not easy, but it was made in order to protect the interests of the club. He also said that the club will continue to fight for its place in European competitions.</p>
<p>Buducnost had a great season last year and they managed to reach the final of the Adriatic League. However, they were defeated by Crvena zvezda from Serbia. This year, they will have to compete against teams like Partizan from Serbia, Fenerbahce from Turkey and Olympiacos from Greece in order to reach the final again.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Backoff-puts-spotlight-on-other-forms-of-revenue"><a href="#Casino-Backoff-puts-spotlight-on-other-forms-of-revenue" class="headerlink" title="Casino Backoff puts spotlight on other forms of revenue"></a>Casino Backoff puts spotlight on other forms of revenue</h1><p>Casino operators are always looking for new and innovative ways to bring in revenue, and in the wake of the recent crackdown on [1]backoff games at casinos across the country, some have turned their attention to other methods.</p>
<p>One such approach is to focus on [2]entertainment and special events. This can involve everything from inviting well-known performers to the casino to staging major tournaments or competitions. And while it may not be as lucrative as backoff, it can still be a major draw for customers.</p>
<p>Another avenue that casinos are exploring is changes to their loyalty programs. By making it easier for players to earn rewards and bonuses, casinos can entice them to return more often and spend more money while they’re there. This can include anything from complimentary meals or hotel stays to bonus points that can be redeemed for cash or other prizes.</p>
<p>Finally, many casinos are turning to online gambling as a way of boosting revenue. This has become especially popular in countries where brick-and-mortar casinos are not allowed, and it allows players from all over the world to access casino games 24&#x2F;7. In fact, some experts believe that online gambling will soon eclipse traditional gambling in terms of revenue generated.</p>
<p>So while the crackdown on backoff games may present some short-term challenges for casino operators, it’s clear that they’re already beginning to explore other ways of bringing in revenue. And with so many options available, it’s likely that they will be able to find something that works for them.</p>
