People seem to love to watch other people’s lives unravel on television. While some moments may fade away over time, others will be remembered for years to come.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most memorable reality TV moments that we can expect to still be talking about in 10 years:</p>
<ol>
<li>When Omarosa was fired from The Apprentice.</li>
</ol>
<p>This moment was definitely one of the most memorable in The Apprentice history. Omarosa was known for being a drama queen and stirring up trouble on the show. So when Donald Trump finally fired her, it was a long overdue moment.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>“You’re fired!”</li>
</ol>
<p>Donald Trump’s infamous catchphrase will always be remembered when it comes to reality TV. His use of it on The Apprentice made him a household name. And, let’s face it, it’s just a really fun phrase to say.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Ryan Lochte lying about being robbed at the Olympics.</li>
</ol>
<p>This moment was definitely one of the most scandalous in recent memory. Ryan Lochte lied about being robbed at gunpoint during the Rio Olympics, but it all came out eventually that he had faked the whole story. This moment showed that you can’t trust everything you see on reality TV… or anywhere else for that matter!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Bethenny Frankel leaving RHONY.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bethenny Frankel has been a staple on RHONY since the show first aired in 2008. So when she announced she was leaving after Season 7, it came as a huge shock to fans of the show. Her feud with fellow castmate Carole Radziwill was a big part of her decision to leave, and it was definitely a dramatic departure.</p>
<h1 id="Why-will-these-particular-moments-be-remembered"><a href="#Why-will-these-particular-moments-be-remembered" class="headerlink" title="Why will these particular moments be remembered?"></a>Why will these particular moments be remembered?</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>There are moments in life that are significant, that we remember for years to come. Some of these moments are happy, some are sad, but they all have a lasting impact on us. Why do certain moments stand out more than others? What makes them so memorable?</p>
<p>For many people, the birth of a child is one of the most memorable moments. It is a time of pure joy and love, as a new life enters the world. Parents often look back on this moment with happiness and fond memories.</p>
<p>Another memorable moment can be the death of a loved one. This can be a time of great sadness, but it can also be a time when people come together to support one another. Grief can be a powerful force, and it often leaves a lasting impression on those who experience it.</p>
<p>Some memorable moments are simply happy ones. A wedding, for example, is often considered a very special day. People look back on weddings with fondness and happiness, remembering all the good times they had. Other joyful occasions, such as graduations or birthdays, can also be very memorable.</p>
<p>There are also many sad moments that people remember long after they have happened. A heartbreak, for example, can be very painful and leave a lasting mark on our lives. Divorce or the loss of a job can also be difficult experiences that change us permanently.</p>
<p>So why do certain moments stick in our minds more than others? There is no simple answer to this question. It could be because of the emotions involved, or because of something that happened at that particular time. Whatever the reason may be, these moments will always stay with us.</p>
<h1 id="How-will-they-be-remembered"><a href="#How-will-they-be-remembered" class="headerlink" title="How will they be remembered?"></a>How will they be remembered?</h1><p>When looking back on the lives of celebrities and public figures, there are always a few key moments that stand out. Some achieved greatness in their field and will be remembered for their accomplishments. Others, however, will be best remembered for their more scandalous moments. Here are some of the most memorable legacies left by celebrities and public figures.</p>
<p>Elvis Presley is often considered one of the greatest musicians of all time. He was a pioneer in rock and roll music and had a massive influence on subsequent generations of artists. However, he is also remembered for his many scandals. He was known for his partying lifestyle and for his affairs with multiple women. His death also generated a lot of controversy, as it was initially believed that he died from a drug overdose.</p>
<p>Michael Jackson was another musician who had a huge impact on popular culture. He was extremely popular among both adults and children, and his albums continue to sell millions of copies worldwide. However, Jackson is also remembered for his many scandals. He was accused of child molestation on multiple occasions, and he faced numerous other allegations throughout his life. His death also sparked controversy, as some people claimed that he had been murdered.</p>
<p>Bill Cosby is one of the most well-known comedians in the world. He is famous for his work on The Cosby Show, which was one of the biggest sitcoms of the 1980s. However, Cosby’s legacy has been tarnished in recent years due to numerous sexual assault allegations against him. To date, over 60 women have came forward to accuse Cosby of sexual assault.</p>
<p> Tiger Woods is arguably the greatest golfer of all time. He has won 14 major championships, amassing more than $1 billion in career earnings along the way. However, Woods is also remembered for his extramarital affairs. In 2009, it was revealed that Woods had been cheating on his wife with multiple women. This led to a massive media scandal and eventually resulted in Woods’ divorce.</p>
<h1 id="Who-will-remember-them"><a href="#Who-will-remember-them" class="headerlink" title="Who will remember them?"></a>Who will remember them?</h1><p>In the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC there is a quote from Martin Niemoller that is engraved on a wall:</p>
<p>First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out- because I was not a Socialist.<br>Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out- because I was not a Trade Unionist.<br>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out- because I was not a Jew.<br>Then they came for me- and there was no one left to speak for me.</p>
<p>This quote speaks to the idea that if we do not act when others are persecuted, then we may be next. It is important to remember those who have been persecuted in the past in order to prevent such atrocities from happening again.</p>
<p>Holocaust Memorial Day is observed annually on January 27th in remembrance of the Holocaust. The Holocaust was a genocide in which Nazi Germany killed six million Jews. It is important to remember this atrocity so that it never happens again.</p>
<p>Many people choose to observe Holocaust Memorial Day by honoring the victims of the Holocaust and by taking action to prevent genocide from occurring in the future. There are many ways to take action, including raising awareness, promoting education, and funding projects that work to prevent genocide.</p>
<p>The United Nations has designated January 27th as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. This day is commemorated globally with ceremonies and educational events that promote remembrance and understanding of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>It is important for everyone to learn about the Holocaust so that we can work to prevent similar atrocities from happening in the future. The Holocaust Museum offers an online course called Remembering Genocide: Learning from the Holocaust that provides an overview of the history of genocide and teaches participants how to recognize warning signs of genocide so that they can take action before it’s too late.</p>
<p>There are also many resources available for educators who want to teach about the Holocaust in their classrooms. The US Department of Education offers a website called Facing History and Ourselves that provides teaching materials on many different topics related to human rights and social justice. This website includes lesson plans, videos, articles, and more on topics such as racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry, patriotism, and more.</p>
<p>The importance of remembering the Holocaust cannot be understated. We must remember what happened so that we can work to prevent similar atrocities from happening in the future.</p>
<h1 id="When-will-they-be-remembered"><a href="#When-will-they-be-remembered" class="headerlink" title="When will they be remembered?"></a>When will they be remembered?</h1><p>The 20th century was a time of great progress for the world. New technologies were developed, old ones improved, and knowledge expanded at an unprecedented rate. But as the 21st century marches on, which figures from the 20th century will be remembered?</p>
<p>Some are already becoming faded memories. For example, few people under the age of 30 know who John F Kennedy was. Even fewer know about his assassination. Andrey Sakharov is another example; though he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, today few people have even heard his name.</p>
<p>Other historical figures are becoming more and more obscure. Take John Maynard Keynes, for instance; his economic theories were once highly respected, but they are now largely forgotten. Or Max Born, who won a Nobel Prize in physics in 1954 but is now barely remembered outside of academic circles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some figures from the 20th century are only becoming more famous with time. Adolf Hitler is a prime example; his atrocities are now well known across the globe, and his name is synonymous with evil. Similarly, Martin Luther King Jr is remembered not just for his work towards racial equality but also for his inspiring speeches.</p>
<p>So who will be remembered from the 20th century? It’s impossible to say for sure, but it’s likely that many of the most important figures have yet to be born. Only time will tell…</p>
