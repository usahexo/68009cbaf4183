      		<h1 id="888Sport-Claims-Oxford-Casino-Is-In-Maine"><a href="#888Sport-Claims-Oxford-Casino-Is-In-Maine" class="headerlink" title="888Sport Claims Oxford Casino Is In Maine"></a>888Sport Claims Oxford Casino Is In Maine</h1><p>888Sport, an online sportsbook, has released a statement claiming that Oxford Casino is in the state of Maine. The casino is located in the town of Oxford, which is in Androscoggin County.</p>
<p>This would not be the first time that a casino has been placed in the wrong state by 888Sport. In February of 2018, they claimed that DraftKings was located in Rhode Island when it was actually located in Massachusetts. This mistake cost DraftKings $170,000.</p>
<p>The Maine Gambling Control Board has since weighed in on the matter, and they say that there is no evidence that Oxford Casino is located in Maine. This has not stopped 888Sport from standing by their claim.</p>
<h1 id="The-Dispute-Over-Oxford-Casino’s-Location"><a href="#The-Dispute-Over-Oxford-Casino’s-Location" class="headerlink" title="The Dispute Over Oxford Casino’s Location"></a>The Dispute Over Oxford Casino’s Location</h1><p>The controversy over Oxford Casino’s location began on March 21st when 888Sport released a statement saying that the casino was located in Maine. This claim was quickly disputed by the Maine Gambling Control Board, who stated that there was no evidence to support 888Sport’s assertion.</p>
<p>The Gambling Control Board went on to say that they had contacted 888Sport several times and requested information about their decision to list Oxford Casino as being located in Maine, but they had not received a response.</p>
<p>888Sport has refused to back down from their assertion that Oxford Casino is located in Maine. They have stated that they are confident in their information and stand by their decision to list the casino as being situated in the Pine Tree State.</p>
<h1 id="Lawsuit-Over-Oxford-Casino-Location-Heating-Up"><a href="#Lawsuit-Over-Oxford-Casino-Location-Heating-Up" class="headerlink" title="Lawsuit Over Oxford Casino Location Heating Up"></a>Lawsuit Over Oxford Casino Location Heating Up</h1><p>The battle over the location of the new Oxford casino is heating up, as one town is filing a lawsuit to try and stop the construction.</p>
<p>The town of Oxford is arguing that the casino should not be built so close to their town, as it will cause major traffic and safety problems. They are asking for the court to halt the construction of the casino, which is scheduled to open in late 2018.</p>
<p>However, the company behind the casino disagrees with this assessment, and argues that the casino will actually benefit Oxford by creating jobs and generating tax revenue. They also argue that the town does not have any legal standing to file a lawsuit, as it is not their jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p>This case is expected to go to trial later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Is-The-Oxford-Casino-Really-In-Maine"><a href="#Is-The-Oxford-Casino-Really-In-Maine" class="headerlink" title="Is The Oxford Casino Really In Maine?"></a>Is The Oxford Casino Really In Maine?</h1><p>Some people seem to think that the Oxford Casino is actually in Maine, but is it really? Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<p>When you look at a map of Maine, you’ll see that the Oxford Casino is not actually in Maine. It’s located in Massachusetts, which is right next to Maine. If you were to drive from the Oxford Casino to downtown Portland, Maine, it would only take about an hour.</p>
<p>So why do people think that the Oxford Casino is in Maine? Probably because of its name. The casino was named after Oxford, Maine, which is a town that is located close to the casino. But just because the casino was named after a town in Maine doesn’t mean that it’s actually in Maine.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a casino that’s located in Maine, then you should visit one of the casinos that are located in Bangor or Lewiston. These casinos are owned and operated by the state of Maine and they offer some great gambling options.</p>
<h1 id="Maine-Officials-Refuse-To-Confirm-Oxford-Casino-Location"><a href="#Maine-Officials-Refuse-To-Confirm-Oxford-Casino-Location" class="headerlink" title="Maine Officials Refuse To Confirm Oxford Casino Location"></a>Maine Officials Refuse To Confirm Oxford Casino Location</h1><p>The much-anticipated Oxford Casino, slated to open in early 2012, has been shrouded in secrecy since it was first announced. The exact location of the casino has been a mystery, with only slipshod hints from state officials.</p>
<p>But now, local media in Maine are reporting that state officials have refused to confirm the location of the Oxford Casino. A spokesman for the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development told the Lewiston Sun Journal that “it would not be appropriate” to release the information.</p>
<p>This comes as a surprise to many in the community, who had assumed that the casino would be built in the town of Oxford. Rumors had been flying for months about where exactly the casino would be located, but no firm evidence had been released.</p>
<p>This lack of transparency from state officials has angered some local residents, who feel that they have been left out of the decision-making process. “I think it’s ridiculous,” said one resident of Oxford. “The town should have a say in this.”</p>
<p>Others are more optimistic about the casino and its potential benefits for the community. “It will be nice to have some extra money coming into town,” said another resident.</p>
<p>Whatever people’s opinions about the casino, it seems clear that state officials are trying to keep as much information about it secret as possible. This has generated concern among many locals who are worried about how the casino will impact their community.</p>
<h1 id="Location-Of-Oxford-Casino-Remains-A-Mystery"><a href="#Location-Of-Oxford-Casino-Remains-A-Mystery" class="headerlink" title="Location Of Oxford Casino Remains A Mystery"></a>Location Of Oxford Casino Remains A Mystery</h1><p>The whereabouts of the new Oxford Casino, which is slated to open next month, remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Rumors have circulated that the casino is being built in either Oxford or Berlin, but officials from both towns have denied those rumors.</p>
<p>“There’s been no formal announcement from the casino people yet,” said Oxford Town Manager Don Lowe. “I’m as anxious as anyone to find out where it’s going to be.”</p>
<p>Casino officials have refused to comment on the location of the new casino.</p>
<p>“We’re not ready to make an announcement yet,” said Cynthia Sequin, a spokesperson for the casino. “We still have some things to work out.”</p>
<p>Residents in both towns are eager for the casino to open, hoping that it will bring jobs and economic development to their area.</p>
<p>“It would be great if it was in Oxford,” said Lowe. “It would help us keep our young people here and bring in some new business.”</p>
<p>“I’m just happy it’s coming somewhere close by,” said Berlin resident Peggy Gray. “I really hope it helps put Berlin back on its feet.”</p>
