This year, all eyes are on Juventus as they bid to win their seventh title in a row. However, there are several other teams who could upset the odds and snatch the championship from under Juventus’ noses.</p>
<p>Napoli are the team most likely to challenge Juve for the title this year. They finished just four points behind the champions last season, and have made some shrewd signings in the summer transfer window. AS Roma are also worth keeping an eye on; they finished third last season and have strengthened their squad with some impressive signings, including Malcom from Bordeaux.</p>
<p>It would be foolish to rule out Inter Milan either; they finished fourth last season and have made some impressive additions to their squad, including Radja Nainggolan and Stefan De Vrij. Lazio are also a dark horse candidate for the title; they finished fifth last season but have made some good signings over the summer, including Joaquin Correa from Sevilla.</p>
<p>So, who do you think will win the Serie A Roulette Championship this year? Will Juventus continue their dominance or will another team step up and take the crown? Place your bets now and find out!</p>
<h1 id="Juventus-and-Napoli-Neck-and-Neck-in-Roulette-Serie-A-Race"><a href="#Juventus-and-Napoli-Neck-and-Neck-in-Roulette-Serie-A-Race" class="headerlink" title="Juventus and Napoli Neck and Neck in Roulette Serie A Race"></a>Juventus and Napoli Neck and Neck in Roulette Serie A Race</h1><p>After a long and arduous season, the race for the Serie A title is coming down to the wire. Juventus hold a slim one-point lead over Napoli, but with just a handful of games remaining, it’s anyone’s race to win.</p>
<p>Napoli have been in fine form all season long, thanks in no small part to their talismanic striker Gonzalo Higuain. The Argentine has scored an impressive 26 goals in 34 appearances this season, and looks well on course to break the league’s scoring record.</p>
<p>Juventus have also enjoyed a successful season, thanks in large part to their key man Paulo Dybala. The young Argentine has been in terrific form, scoring 16 goals in 29 appearances.</p>
<p>Both teams will be looking to take home the Serie A title this season, and it promises to be a fascinating battle between two of Europe’s finest sides. With both teams neck and neck, it’s going to be an exciting few weeks as we see who comes out on top.</p>
<h1 id="AC-Milan-Ready-to-Pounce-If-Juventus-or-Napoli-Falter-in-the-Roulette-Serie-A-Race"><a href="#AC-Milan-Ready-to-Pounce-If-Juventus-or-Napoli-Falter-in-the-Roulette-Serie-A-Race" class="headerlink" title="AC Milan Ready to Pounce If Juventus or Napoli Falter in the Roulette Serie A Race"></a>AC Milan Ready to Pounce If Juventus or Napoli Falter in the Roulette Serie A Race</h1><p>Serie A has been a two-horse race all season long, with Juventus and Napoli battling it out for the league title. But with just a few games remaining, it appears as if AC Milan are ready to pounce if one of those teams falters.</p>
<p>The Rossoneri have been in excellent form of late, winning their last five league games to move up to third in the table. That’s good enough for an automatic Champions League spot, but they are not done yet. With just four points separating them from second-place Napoli and six points from leaders Juventus, there is still some hope that they can catch up and win their first league title since 2011.</p>
<p>Of course, it won’t be easy. Juve have been by far the best team in Italy this season and look destined to win their seventh consecutive title. But Napoli are not far behind and could easily slip up in the last few games. If that happens, Milan will be there to take advantage.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that they have the talent to do so. The likes of Suso, Patrick Cutrone, and Gianluigi Donnarumma make them a very dangerous team going forward, while Leonardo Bonucci brings experience and leadership at the back. They will certainly be tough opponents for any team left in the race for the title.</p>
<p>But can they pull off a miraculous comeback? Only time will tell. In the meantime, you can be sure that they will continue to fight until the very end in order to bring home Serie A’s biggest prize.</p>
<h1 id="AS-Roma-Struggling-in-Roulette-Serie-A-but-Still-Have-a-Shot-at-the-Title"><a href="#AS-Roma-Struggling-in-Roulette-Serie-A-but-Still-Have-a-Shot-at-the-Title" class="headerlink" title="AS Roma Struggling in Roulette Serie A but Still Have a Shot at the Title"></a>AS Roma Struggling in Roulette Serie A but Still Have a Shot at the Title</h1><p>As the season comes to a close, Roma has been facing some struggles in their roulette-style Serie A. But they are still in the running for the title.</p>
<p>Roma started the season off strong, but they have been struggling lately. Their last few matches have not been going as planned, and they have even lost a few of them. They are currently in third place in the Serie A table, with 69 points. This is 14 points behind first-place Juventus and 4 points behind second-place Napoli. While it’s not impossible for them to make a comeback and win the title, it will be difficult.</p>
<p>One of Roma’s biggest problems this season has been their inconsistency. They have had trouble maintaining momentum throughout the season. This was especially evident in their performances against weaker teams. They would often win easily against weaker opponents, but then struggle against better teams. Against teams like Juventus and Napoli, they were often unable to keep up and ended up losing.</p>
<p>Their inconsistency can also be seen in their goal scoring record. They have scored 59 goals this season, which is 2nd best in Serie A. However, they have also conceded 44 goals, which is the most out of any team that is currently in contention for a top 4 spot. This means that they often struggle to keep a clean sheet, which makes it difficult for them to win matches.</p>
<p>Despite these struggles, there are still some things that Roma does well. For example, they are good at creating chances and controlling possession of the ball. This was especially evident in their match against Genoa a few weeks ago. In that match, Roma had 78% possession and created 23 chances compared to Genoa’s 5 chances. Even though they didn’t end up winning that match, it shows how dangerous they can be when they are on top of their game.</p>
<p>If Roma can fix their consistency issues and score more goals against better teams, then they still have a shot at winning the title this season.</p>
<h1 id="Inter-Milan-Hoping-for-a-Late-Surge-to-Catch-Up-in-Roulette-Serie-A"><a href="#Inter-Milan-Hoping-for-a-Late-Surge-to-Catch-Up-in-Roulette-Serie-A" class="headerlink" title="Inter Milan Hoping for a Late Surge to Catch Up in Roulette Serie A"></a>Inter Milan Hoping for a Late Surge to Catch Up in Roulette Serie A</h1><p> Inter Milan has always been a powerhouse in Italy, but this season they have fallen behind early on. Juventus is currently leading the pack with Napoli not too far behind. However, Inter is hoping they can make a late surge to catch up and win their 7th Serie A title.</p>
<p>Inter’s biggest issue so far has been their lack of scoring goals. They are currently ranked at 13th in the league for most goals scored. Mauro Icardi, their top scorer, has only scored 5 goals this season. Additionally, they have been struggling to keep clean sheets. In their last 10 games, they have only managed to keep 2 clean sheets. This has led to them dropping a lot of points that they cannot afford to lose if they want to catch up to Juventus and Napoli.</p>
<p>However, things are looking up for Inter Milan as they have just announced the signing of Keita Balde from Lazio. Keita is a very versatile player and should help bolster Inter’s attack. Additionally, with Ivan Perisic rumored to be on his way out, Keita could potentially become a starter for Inter Milan.</p>
<p>Inter also has some favourable fixtures coming up which should help them climb the table. They will be facing teams like Genoa, Chievo Verona, and SPAL who they should be able to beat if they play at their best. If they can manage to win most of these games, they could potentially make a late surge and win the Serie A title.</p>
