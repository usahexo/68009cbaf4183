        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Juventus-Crowned-Champions-As-They-Edge-Out-Napoli-To-Win-Seventh-Straight-Title"><a href="#Juventus-Crowned-Champions-As-They-Edge-Out-Napoli-To-Win-Seventh-Straight-Title" class="headerlink" title="Juventus Crowned Champions As They Edge Out Napoli To Win Seventh Straight Title"></a>Juventus Crowned Champions As They Edge Out Napoli To Win Seventh Straight Title</h1><p>Juventus were crowned champions for the seventh consecutive season on Sunday, as they edged out Napoli to win the Serie A title.</p>
<p>Napoli were looking to claim their first Serie A title since 1990, but Juve had other ideas and proved to be too strong for them in the end.</p>
<p>The victory was made even sweeter for Juventus by the fact that it came at the expense of their bitter rivals Napoli.</p>
<p>Napoli took an early lead through Lorenzo Insigne, but goals from Gonzalo Higuain and Alex Sandro saw Juventus take a 2-1 lead into half time.</p>
<p>Dries Mertens equalized for Napoli in the second half, but it was not enough to prevent Juventus from winning their 34th Serie A title.</p>
<p>“We fought tooth and nail until the end and deserved to win this title,” said Juventus captain Gigi Buffon after the game. “These seven Scudetti are a result of great team work. We have had some difficult moments along the way, but we never gave up.”</p>
<p>Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri was also full of praise for his players after they secured another championship.</p>
<p>“I am delighted for my players and for all of Juventus fans,” said Allegri. “This Scudetto is down to their hard work and determination over the past few years.”</p>
<h1 id="Roma-Secure-Third-Place-After-Destroying-Sampdoria-In-Dramatic-Match"><a href="#Roma-Secure-Third-Place-After-Destroying-Sampdoria-In-Dramatic-Match" class="headerlink" title="Roma Secure Third Place After Destroying Sampdoria In Dramatic Match"></a>Roma Secure Third Place After Destroying Sampdoria In Dramatic Match</h1><p>Roma’s last match of the season was a thrilling 3-2 victory over Sampdoria which saw them secure third place in Serie A and automatic qualification for the Champions League.</p>
<p>The first goal of the match came after just two minutes, as Edin Dzeko pounced on a mistake by Sampdoria goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano to give Roma the lead. The home side then doubled their advantage in the 17th minute when Stephan El Shaarawy latched onto a through ball from Lorenzo Pellegrini and finished expertly past Viviano.</p>
<p>Sampdoria did pull one back before halftime through Fabio Quagliarella, but Roma restored their two-goal advantage shortly after the break when Diego Perotti scored from the penalty spot. Jakub Jankto then gave Sampdoria hope with a goal in the 73rd minute, but Dzeko sealed the win for Roma in stoppage time with his second goal of the match.</p>
<p>With Juventus winning their seventh consecutive Serie A title, Roma’s third-place finish means they will enter next season’s Champions League in the group stage rather than having to go through a qualifying round. This is a huge boost for Eusebio Di Francesco’s side, who will be looking to make an impact in Europe’s top club competition next season.</p>
<h1 id="Milan-End-Season-In-Disappointment-As-They-Miss-Out-On-European-Qualification"><a href="#Milan-End-Season-In-Disappointment-As-They-Miss-Out-On-European-Qualification" class="headerlink" title="Milan End Season In Disappointment As They Miss Out On European Qualification"></a>Milan End Season In Disappointment As They Miss Out On European Qualification</h1><p>After three years of success in which they finished in the top four of Serie A, qualified for the Champions League and reached the semi-final stage of the competition, Milan’s 2017-18 season ended in disappointment as they missed out on European qualification.</p>
<p>Gennaro Gattuso was appointed as manager in November following the sacking of Vincenzo Montella, but he was unable to steer the club to a top four finish, with Milan finishing in sixth place in the table.</p>
<p>The Rossoneri were inconsistent throughout the season and suffered several heavy defeats, including a 5-1 loss away at Napoli in March which effectively ended their hopes of qualifying for Europe.</p>
<p>Milan’s only real highlights of the season were two wins against Juventus, one in Serie A and one in the Coppa Italia.</p>
<p>Despite this disappointing end to the season, there are some reasons for optimism for Milan supporters. The club have invested heavily in new players over the past year, with big money signings such as Leonardo Bonucci, Nikola Kalinic and Andre Silva arriving at San Siro.</p>
<p>They also have some promising young players such as Gianluigi Donnarumma and Patrick Cutrone who will only get better with more experience.</p>
<p>Gattuso has shown that he is capable of getting the best out of these players and he will be looking to lead Milan back into contention for European qualification next season.</p>
<h1 id="Inter-Milan-Finish-Fourth-As-Attackers-Falter-In-Last-Games-Of-The-Season"><a href="#Inter-Milan-Finish-Fourth-As-Attackers-Falter-In-Last-Games-Of-The-Season" class="headerlink" title="Inter Milan Finish Fourth As Attackers Falter In Last Games Of The Season"></a>Inter Milan Finish Fourth As Attackers Falter In Last Games Of The Season</h1><p>Inter Milan narrowly missed out on Champions League football for the 2018-19 season, as they could only muster a fourth-place finish in Serie A. This was despite their excellent form in the first half of the season - they were top of the table at one point. The main reason for their subsequent poor results has been attributed to their lacklustre attack.</p>
<p> Mauro Icardi, who is usually known as a goal scorer, only registered six goals in the last 17 games of the season. This is considerably lower than his tally in earlier fixtures; he netted 11 goals in his first 15 appearances. Winger Ivan Perisic was also less prolific in the latter stages of the campaign, scoring just four goals in 16 games, compared to 10 goals in his first 18 appearances.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for this dip in form is that opponents have started to figure out how to defend against them. However, an alternative explanation is that both Icardi and Perisic may be suffering from fatigue after playing so many games over the last few months.</p>
<p>In any case, Inter will need to find a way to improve their attacking prowess next season if they hope to qualify for Europe’s premier club competition.</p>
<h1 id="Atalanta’s-Fabulous-Season-Ends-With-Fifth-Place-And-Europa-League-qualification"><a href="#Atalanta’s-Fabulous-Season-Ends-With-Fifth-Place-And-Europa-League-qualification" class="headerlink" title="Atalanta’s Fabulous Season Ends With Fifth Place And Europa League qualification"></a>Atalanta’s Fabulous Season Ends With Fifth Place And Europa League qualification</h1><p>This season, Atalanta defied all expectations. Finishing in fifth place in Serie A and qualifying for the Europa League is an amazing achievement for a club that had never finished higher than 12th before this campaign.</p>
<p>Led by captain Alejandro Gomez and Mauro Icardi, the team played some scintillating football at times, scoring 79 goals in 38 games – more than any other side outside of the top four. Gomez was by far their most important player, contributing 24 goals and 11 assists to the side’s cause.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their European campaign came to an early end as they were knocked out by Arsenal in the last 16. However, they can be proud of their achievements this season and will be looking to build on them next year.</p>
<h1 id="Atalanta’s-Season-In-Review"><a href="#Atalanta’s-Season-In-Review" class="headerlink" title="Atalanta’s Season In Review"></a>Atalanta’s Season In Review</h1><p>After finishing 12th in Serie A last season, many pundits were predicting that Atalanta would struggle again this year. However, led by captain Alejandro Gomez and Mauro Icardi, the team played some scintillating football at times, scoring 79 goals in 38 games – more than any other side outside of the top four. Gomez was by far their most important player, contributing 24 goals and 11 assists to the side’s cause.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their European campaign came to an early end as they were knocked out by Arsenal in the last 16. However, they can be proud of their achievements this season and will be looking to build on them next year.</p>
