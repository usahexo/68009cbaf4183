It is a fairly simple game to play, and can be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>The basic premise of the game is to connect as many of the same colored balls together as possible. When you have connected four or more of the same color, they will disappear from the board, and you will earn points. The game ends when there are no more balls left on the board.</p>
<p>There are a few different power-ups that you can use to help you win the game. The bomb will explode, clearing away any adjacent balls. The clock will freeze time for a few seconds, giving you some extra time to make moves. And the shield will protect your balls from being destroyed.</p>
<p>You can also earn extra points by completing combos. When you connect four or more of the same color in a row, column, or diagonal, you will earn combo points.</p>
<p>There are three different game modes to choose from: Classic, Survival, and Time Attack. In Classic mode, you must survive until there are no more balls left on the board. In Survival mode, you must keep going for as long as possible. And in Time Attack mode, you race against the clock to see how many points you can score in two minutes.</p>
<p>Auto Tombala is a lot of fun, and it’s easy to learn how to play. Give it a try today!</p>
