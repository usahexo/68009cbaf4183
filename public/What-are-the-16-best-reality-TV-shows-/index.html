<h1 id="Who-decides-which-reality-TV-shows-are-the-best"><a href="#Who-decides-which-reality-TV-shows-are-the-best" class="headerlink" title="Who decides which reality TV shows are the best?"></a>Who decides which reality TV shows are the best?</h1><p>There has been some debate over which reality TV show is the best. This has led to people asking who decides which reality TV shows are the best. Some people might say that it is the general public who decide through ratings and viewership. However, there are others who might say that it is the producers or networks who decide which shows are the best.</p>
<p>There are a few factors that need to be considered when deciding which show is the best. One of these factors is ratings. The general public might vote with their feet by watching a show and this will help to determine its success. Producers and networks might also look at ratings as well as viewership when making a decision about a show’s success. </p>
<p>Another factor that needs to be considered is the quality of the show. This can be determined by how well the show is produced, whether or not it has good story lines and how likeable the participants are. If a show ticks all of these boxes, then it is likely to be labelled as one of the best reality TV shows around. </p>
<p>So, who really decides which reality TV shows are the best? It could be argued that both the general public and producers have a say in this. However, ultimately it is up to individual viewers to decide what they think is the best show out there.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-they-decide-which-reality-TV-shows-are-the-best"><a href="#How-do-they-decide-which-reality-TV-shows-are-the-best" class="headerlink" title="How do they decide which reality TV shows are the best?"></a>How do they decide which reality TV shows are the best?</h1><p>We all have our favorite reality TV shows. But how do the networks decide which ones to air and which ones to keep on the air? </p>
<p>There is no one answer to this question, as networks consider a variety of factors when choosing their reality TV programming. Some of the most important factors include ratings, public reaction, and production costs. </p>
<p>A show’s ratings are always an important consideration for a network. After all, they need to ensure that the show is drawing in enough viewers to be profitable. If a show isn’t performing well in the ratings, it is likely to get cancelled. </p>
<p>Public reaction is also taken into account by networks when deciding which reality TV shows to air. For example, if there is a lot of backlash against a certain show, it may not be renewed for another season. </p>
<p>Production costs are another important consideration for networks. A reality TV show that is expensive to produce may not be renewed if there are cheaper alternatives available. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the decision of which reality TV shows to keep on the air lies with the network executives and it can vary from year to year depending on what is popular at the time.</p>
<h1 id="What-happens-to-reality-TV-shows-that-are-not-considered-the-best"><a href="#What-happens-to-reality-TV-shows-that-are-not-considered-the-best" class="headerlink" title="What happens to reality TV shows that are not considered the best?"></a>What happens to reality TV shows that are not considered the best?</h1><p>There are a lot of reality TV shows on air, and not all of them are the best. In fact, there are some that are downright terrible. What happens to these reality TV shows when they are not considered the best?</p>
<p>The answer is that they often get cancelled. A lot of networks will cancel a reality TV show if it is not doing well in the ratings. This is because they do not want to waste money on a show that is not popular with viewers.</p>
<p>While some networks will cancel a reality TV show that is not doing well, others may keep it on the air for a little while longer. However, they will usually make changes to it in an attempt to improve its ratings. For example, they may move it to a different time slot or change the format of the show.</p>
<p>In the end, though, if a reality TV show is not considered the best, there is a good chance that it will get cancelled.</p>
<h1 id="Why-are-somereality-TV-shows-more-popular-than-others"><a href="#Why-are-somereality-TV-shows-more-popular-than-others" class="headerlink" title="Why are somereality TV shows more popular than others?"></a>Why are somereality TV shows more popular than others?</h1><p>There are a lot of different factors that can contribute to the popularity of a reality TV show. Some of the most common reasons include the casting, the setting, and the twist or gimmick of the show.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors in determining a reality TV show’s popularity is the casting. If the cast is likable, people will be more likely to tune in. Additionally, if the cast is diverse and includes people from different backgrounds, it can help to attract viewers.</p>
<p>The setting of a reality TV show can also play a role in its popularity. If it takes place in an interesting or exotic location, people may be more likely to watch it. Likewise, if there is a suspenseful or dramatic storyline unfolding, viewers will be more likely to tune in.</p>
<p>Finally, the twist or gimmick of a reality TV show can make it more popular than others. Some examples include shows that feature tasks or challenges that are particularly difficult, elimination rounds where contestants are voted off one by one, or shows that have unique formats.</p>
