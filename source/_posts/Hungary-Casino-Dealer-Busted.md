#  Blackjack Dealer in Hungary Busted

Prosecutors in Hungary have arrested a blackjack dealer at a casino in the capital, Budapest, on suspicion of rigging the game by using marked cards.

The dealer, who has not yet been named, is alleged to have altered the cards so that he could ensure profits for himself and for other members of his betting syndicate.

The suspect was apprehended after investigators received a tip-off from another casino worker. It is understood that the dealer has confessed to the offence.

This is not the first time that allegations of card-rigging have surfaced at casinos in Hungary. In December 2017, two men were arrested in connection with a similar scheme at a different Budapest casino.

#  Dealer Fails to Bust in Hungary Casino Blackjack

Recently, in the Orbán V. Casino in Budapest, Hungary, a blackjack dealer failed to bust when required to do so and lost the casino tens of thousands of euros as a result. The incident has sparked outrage throughout the casino community and raised new questions about the casino gaming industry.

According to reports, the blackjack dealer in question was required to hit on a 12 but instead stopped at 11, resulting in a final hand of 21. This mistake cost the casino EURO 38,000, as the dealer would have busted if they had hit.

This isn't the first time that something like this has happened; dealers in casinos around the world have been known to make mistakes that cost their employers money. However, this particular incident has generated a lot of backlash because it occurred in a high-stakes game where such a costly mistake can be extremely damaging.

Casino officials have stated that they are investigating the situation and that disciplinary action will be taken against the dealer involved. They also claim that they have taken steps to ensure that this type of mistake doesn't happen again.

Still, many people are skeptical about these claims and believe that more needs to be done to protect casinos from costly errors by dealers. Some have even called for better training programs and more rigorous oversight of dealers in order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

#  No Bust for Dealer in Hungary Blackjack

Las Vegas may have come to embody casino gambling in the popular imagination, but many of the defining characteristics of Sin City card games can be found in their Eastern European counterparts. Take blackjack, for example. The Hungarian version of the game – called twenty-one – is as popular as ever, and recently a dealer at a local casino was acquitted of any wrongdoing after being caught cheating.

Prosecutors alleged that the dealer, Ferenc P., had been dealing himself an extra card on every hand he played since late 2014. This would have given him a significant advantage over other players and led to him winning nearly €200,000 over the course of two years. However, when Ferenc was finally caught in early 2017 he claimed that he had no idea how the extra card had ended up in his hand each time.

The court didn’t believe him, but they also couldn’t find definitive proof that he had cheated. In the end, they ruled that it was impossible to say with certainty whether or not Ferenc had deliberately dealt himself an extra card, and so he was acquitted of all charges.

This isn’t the first time a blackjack dealer has been caught cheating in Hungary – in fact, it’s surprisingly common – but it is unusual for them to escape punishment. In 2012, for example, a dealer named Zoltán K. was sentenced to two years in prison after being caught dealing himself an extra card on several occasions.
