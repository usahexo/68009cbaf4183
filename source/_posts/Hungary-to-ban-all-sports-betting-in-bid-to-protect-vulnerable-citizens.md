#  Hungary to ban all sports betting in bid to protect vulnerable citizens

Hungarian government has announced a ban on all sports betting, in a bid to protect its vulnerable citizens from the harmful effects of gambling.

The Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, made the announcement on Tuesday, saying that the ban will come into effect on 1 January 2019. The move is part of a wider crackdown on gambling in Hungary, which also includes a ban on advertising and a reduction in the number of casinos.

Orban said that the government was introducing the ban to protect “the poorest and most vulnerable members of society” from the harms of gambling. He added that it was also necessary to protect children and young people from developing addictions to gambling.

Hungary is not the only country to introduce a ban on sports betting. In October 2018, Belgium banned all forms of online gambling, including sports betting. And in September 2018, Italy introduced a ban on online sports betting and other forms of gambling.

#  Sports betting set to be illegal in Hungary as of January 1, 2019

Sports betting will be illegal in Hungary as of January 1, 2019, the National Assembly of Hungary decided on Wednesday. The ban will include all forms of sports betting, including online and land-based gambling.

The assembly approved the bill with a unanimous vote, 233-0. The bill now goes to the Senate for final approval, but it is expected to pass without any problems.

“The ban on sports betting is another step in the protection of Hungarian citizens from harmful games,” said Gergely Gulyás, head of the Prime Minister’s Office.

Betting companies reacted to the news by saying that the ban will have a negative effect on both the Hungarian economy and thousands of jobs. Gábor Zoltán Bodolai, CEO of BET365 Magyarország Kft., said that the ban will force his company to close its doors and lay off its 400 employees.

But others welcomed the decision, saying that it is an important step in protecting people from gambling addiction. “We are convinced that this is one of the most important decisions of our time when it comes to public health issues,” said Péter Niedermüller, a member of parliament from the opposition Democratic Coalition (DK).

In addition to sports betting, other forms of gambling will also be illegal in Hungary as of January 1, 2019. This includes casino games, slot machines, and poker.

#  New gambling law in Hungary outlaws sports betting

On 1 January 2019, a new gambling law came into effect in Hungary, outlawing all sports betting. This move is part of the Hungarian government’s attempts to crack down on gambling addiction, and follows a similar law that came into effect in Slovakia in 2018.

Under the new Hungarian law, any form of sports betting is now illegal, including online and land-based betting. The only exceptions are bets placed on horse racing and lottery games. Penalties for breaking the law include fines of up to €1 million and up to two years in prison.

The Hungarian government has said that it is hoping that the new law will help to reduce gambling addiction in the country. According to figures from 2017, there were around 360,000 problem gamblers in Hungary, out of a population of just under 10 million. Officials hope that by outlawing sports betting, they can discourage people from engaging in this type of gambling and reduce the number of problem gamblers.

However, not everyone is happy with the new law. Critics argue that it will drive underground gambling and make it harder for authorities to track down illegal operators. They also argue that it will damage the Hungarian economy as people will switch their spending to other forms of gambling or even black market activities.

So far, it is unclear what impact the new Hungarian gambling law has had on the country’s gambling industry. However, it is expected that there will be a significant decline in the amount of money spent on sports betting, as well as a rise in illegal gambling activities.

#  Hungary Makes Betting on Sports Illegal to Curb Gambling Addiction

In Hungary, a new law has been put into place that will make betting on sports illegal. This measure is being put into place in an attempt to curb gambling addiction in the country. The hope is that this will keep people from spending too much money on gambling and instead, will divert their attention and funds to more productive and responsible activities.

There are many reasons why gambling can be addictive. Some people may enjoy the feeling of risk-taking or the adrenaline rush that comes along with it. Others may find that they are able to escape from their problems or worries by spending time gambling. Whatever the reason may be, it is clear that gambling can be addictive and destructive for some people.

Hungary is not alone in its efforts to curb gambling addiction. In fact, many other countries have similar measures in place. For example, in the United States, there are laws that prohibit certain types of gambling (such as online poker) because of the potential for addiction. Additionally, many countries have outlawed betting on sports altogether in order to discourage people from risking too much money on these activities.

There are mixed opinions on whether or not making betting on sports illegal actually works to curb gambling addiction. Some people believe that it is simply an easy way for governments to avoid taking responsibility for helping those who are addicted to gambling. Others argue that prohibiting betting on sports does help to dissuade people from engaging in this behavior and can ultimately save them from serious financial problems.

Ultimately, the decision on whether or not to bet on sports is a personal one. However, it is important to be aware of the risks involved and understand the possible consequences of becoming addicted to gambling. If you think you may have a problem with gambling, it is important to seek help from a professional therapist or counselor who can assist you in overcoming your addiction

#  Hungary outlaws sports betting in new gambling regulation

The Hungarian parliament has voted to outlaw sports betting in a new gambling regulation that will come into force in January 2020.

The new law, which was passed with 139 votes in favour and one against, will see a ban on all types of betting on sporting events, including online and land-based bookmakers.

While the government said the move was aimed at protecting vulnerable people from the risks of gambling addiction, the gaming industry criticised it as misguided and harmful to the economy.

“This is a very sad day for the Hungarian gaming industry as well as for consumers who will now have fewer legal options to bet on sports,” said Gabor Frohner, chairman of the Hungarian Association of Online Casinos ( HASCO ).

“The government has ignored all of our proposals to amend this destructive bill and has chosen to side with illegal operators over licensed ones. This will only lead to more criminality and job losses in an industry that employs thousands of Hungarians.”
