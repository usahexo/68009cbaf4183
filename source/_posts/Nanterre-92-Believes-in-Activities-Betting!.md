#  Nanterre 92 Believes in Activities Betting!

Nanterre 92 is a basketball club located in Nanterre, France. The team was founded in 1992 and currently plays in the second-level French Pro B league. The club is well known for developing young players, many of whom have gone on to play in the top-level Ligue 1 and elsewhere in Europe.

For the 2017-2018 season, Nanterre 92 decided to try something new: betting on their own activities!

The goal was to create a winning culture and attract new fans, while also making a profit.

The gamble seems to have paid off so far. Nanterre 92 finished first in their Pro B division, earning promotion to the top-level Ligue 1 for the 2018-2019 season. They also reached the finals of the French Cup, losing to AS Monaco. This success has led to increased attendances and a larger fanbase.

#  Nanterre 92: A House of Activity Betting?

Nanterre 92 is a commune in the Hauts-de-Seine department in the Île-de-France region in north-central France. It is located in the western suburbs of Paris, on the left bank of the Seine River, upstream from the Eiffel Tower. With an estimated population of 92,000 as of January 1, 2016, it is one of the most populous communes in France and one of the most populous suburbs of Paris.

The history of Nanterre dates back to prehistoric times. The early inhabitants were farmers and hunters who slowly began to settle small villages around a chapel erected by Saint Genovefa two centuries ago. The Gauls were conquered by Julius Caesar in 52 BC and this area became part of the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis.

In 845 AD, Nanterre was made a royal demesne by Charles the Bald and remained so until 1328 when Philip VI’s daughter Joan II exchanged it for Conflans-Sainte-Honorine which she had just inherited from her father-in-law Robert III of Artois. Joan II, Countess of Auvergne, returned to Nanterre in 1404 after her husband’s death and built a castle which still stands today.

During the French Revolution, Nanterre was renamed “Palais de la Révolution” (Palace of the Revolution) and was used as a tribunal for several revolutionary tribunals which tried King Louis XVI and his associates. On January 10, 1793, Benoit Joseph Mericourt proposed that Nanterre be renamed “Nanterre la liberté” (Nanterre Liberty). The newly named Nanterre La Liberté prospered during the 19th century with the establishment of schools, theatres and other civic institutions.

Today, it is a thriving commune with a mix of industry and commerce along with many cultural institutions including museums, theatres and cinemas. But what about its betting activity?
