#  IRS Now Allows Wagering Loss Deductions for Online Casino Gambling

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced that, for the 2019 tax year, taxpayers are now allowed to deduct their wagering losses incurred from playing at online casinos. The new ruling was made in response to a recent petition filed with the IRS by the American Gaming Association (AGA), which argued that the deduction should be extended to include all forms of gambling, including online casino games.

According to the new ruling, taxpayers are allowed to deduct their gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings. This means that, if you have a net loss from your online casino gambling activities for the year, you can claim that loss as a deduction on your tax return. However, keep in mind that you can only claim losses up to the amount of your winnings; any excess losses cannot be deducted.

In order to qualify for this deduction, you must itemize your deductions on your tax return. If you choose not to itemize, you cannot claim your gambling losses as a deduction. In addition, this deduction is available only to taxpayers who report their gambling income and expenses on Form 1040 Schedule A. Gambling income includes not just winnings from casino games, but also proceeds from lotteries, raffles and horse races.

The new ruling is good news for taxpayers who enjoy playing at online casinos. It allows them to offset some of their losses against other taxable income, which can help reduce their overall tax burden. So if you're expecting a tax refund this year, claiming your wagering losses could help reduce the amount of taxes you have to pay.

#  New Deduction Allows Wagering Losses from Online Casino Gambling

A new federal deduction authorized by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) allows individuals to deduct up to $10,000 in wagering losses from their taxable income. The deduction can be used for any type of wagering, including casino gambling, horse racing, and lottery tickets.

The deduction is available regardless of whether the individual itemizes deductions or takes the standard deduction. In order to claim the deduction, taxpayers must complete Form 1040, Schedule A and attach a statement listing the amount of each wager and the amount of each loss.

The new deduction was welcomed by the casino gambling industry, which has been struggling in recent years due to competition from online casinos. "This is a big win for our industry," said John gambling establishments. "It's going to help us compete against the online casinos and bring more jobs and revenue to states like Nevada."

The American Gaming Association also praised the new deduction, calling it a "positive development" for the casino industry. "We applaud Congress for recognizing the importance of this sector of our economy and enacting this important provision," said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association.

Opponents of gambling argue that the new deduction will lead to increased gambling losses and addiction problems. But supporters argue that it will help level the playing field between casinos and online casinos.

#  Deductions for Wagering Losses from Online Casino Gambling now allowed

The Partial-Year Tax Reform Bill was passed on December 22, 2017, which allows taxpayers to deduct wagering losses incurred in the pursuit of gambling winnings from their taxable income. This includes losses from casino gambling, horse racing, and dog racing.

The deduction is only allowed for so-called “casual gamblers” and not professional gamblers. The deduction cannot exceed the amount of gambling income reported for the year. In order to claim the deduction, taxpayers must itemize deductions on their tax returns.

This change in the tax law is a big win for online casino gambling enthusiasts. It has been a long time coming and should help to legitimize the growing industry.

#  IRS Clarifies Rules for Wagering Loss Deductions from Online Casino Gambling 

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has clarified the rules governing deductions for wagering losses from online casino gambling. The new guidance, which was released in April 2019, effectively reverses a previous IRS ruling that barred taxpayers from deducting any of their gambling losses from online casino gambling.

According to the new guidance, taxpayers can now deduct their total gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings from online casino gambling. This includes both money and fair market value of any prizes or non-cash compensation they receive from online casino gambling. In order to claim a deduction for wagering losses, taxpayers must keep track of their winnings and losses separately for each form of gambling activity.

The new guidance applies to all taxpayers, including those who file their taxes using Form 1040, Schedule A (Itemized Deductions). However, it does not apply to taxpayers who file their taxes using Form 1040A ( simpler tax return) or Form 1040EZ (a very simple tax return). 

The clarification comes as a relief to many taxpayers who enjoy gambling at online casinos. Prior to the release of the new guidance, these taxpayers were not able to deduct any of their losses from online casino gambling, even if they had itemized their deductions on Schedule A. This could lead to a significant increase in taxable income for some taxpayers. 

Taxpayers who have already filed their 2018 taxes using the old rules may be able to claim a refund by filing an amended return. The deadline for filing an amended return is typically three years after the original tax filing date. 

If you have any questions about how the new IRS guidance affects you, please consult with a qualified tax professional.

#  What You Need to Know about Wagering Loss Deductions for Online Casino Gambling

When you gamble in an online casino, your gambling winnings are subject to taxation. However, you may be able to deduct some of your losses from your taxable income. This article will explain the tax rules for wagering loss deductions for online casino gambling.

The first thing to note is that only individuals can claim wagering loss deductions. Businesses cannot claim wagering losses as a business deduction.

In order to claim a wagering loss deduction, you must itemize your deductions on Schedule A of your tax return. You cannot claim a wagering loss deduction if you take the standard deduction.

Your total wagering losses for the year can reduce your taxable income subject to certain limits. The amount of your wagering losses that can be deducted in any given year is limited to the amount of your winnings in that year. In other words, you cannot deduct more than you won in a given year.

For example, if you had $1,000 in winnings and $2,000 in losses, you could only deduct $1,000 of your losses on your tax return. The remaining $1,000 would have to be carried forward and deducted from future years' winnings until it is used up.

There are other restrictions on wagering loss deductions as well. For example, you cannot deduct any losses that were incurred in connection with illegal gambling activities. In addition, you cannot deduct any expenses related to travel or lodging when gambling away from home.

If you have questions about how these rules apply to your specific situation, please consult a qualified tax professional.
