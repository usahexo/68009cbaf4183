#  How Does Reel Poker Work: Bursaspor Style

Reel poker is the online variation of the classic casino game played with a deck of cards. The object of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by assembling a better poker hand. In reel poker, players compete against each other to win a pot that contains all the bets that have been placed during a round of play. The dealer's hand does not participate in the pot.

Bursaspor style reel poker is a popular variation of the game that adds an extra level of excitement to play. In this version, each player has two hidden reel symbols that are randomly assigned at the beginning of the hand. These symbols become important as they determine which players are eligible to win the pot when the hand is over.

To begin, all players are dealt two cards face down. The dealer then flips one card over for all players to see - this is the flop. A second card is flipped over for all players to see - this is the turn. A third and final card is flipped over for all players to see - this is called the river card. After seeing their three cards, players must decide whether to fold or continue in the hand by placing an additional bet, which we'll refer to as 'the call'.

If any player has a pair or better shown on their visible card, they may show their hand and claim the pot automatically. If no player meets this condition, then play proceeds as follows:

  The dealer will first compare her own two cards with those of any player who has remained in the hand. If either player has a higher ranking two-card combination (e.g., Q-J beats 2-6), that player wins and takes possession of the pot; if both combinations are equal, it is a draw and no one wins anything. 
The next step is comparing any three-of-a-kinds among all remaining players. If one player has three-of-a-kind and another player has two pair or better, then that player with three-of-a-kind takes everything; if both players have two pair or better then it's another draw (and again nobody wins anything). Finally, if there are no three-of match or better still remaining in play, then hands containing only one card (pair absent) are compared starting from highest rank downwards until there's a winner; suits do not matter in this last comparison."

#  Watch Out for Bursaspor in the Reel Poker Play-offs

Turkey’s Bursaspor could spring a surprise in the Reel Poker play-offs later this year, according to industry experts.

The club has made some smart signings in the summer transfer window, including experienced players like Mbaye Niang and Ozan Tufan, and will be confident of making an impact in the play-offs.

Reel Poker CEO Michael Case said: "Bursaspor will be one of the clubs to watch out for in the play-offs this year. They have some good players and I think they can do well."
